This project is based on the open-source traffic simulation software MATSIM, part of a research project about how social network affect on people's choice of transportation mode, and how people's daily activity affect the social network strength between individuals. 

I modified both external controler and the matsim core code. New features includes: 
(1) Dynamic individual memory and social network which both evolve every iteration based on the agent's daily experience.
(2) New mode choice procedure taking into account both individual memory after last iteration, and friend's influence from social network.
