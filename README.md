This project is based on the open-source traffic simulation software MATSIM and is part of a research project about how social network affects people's choice of transportation mode, and how people's daily activities affect the social network strength between individuals. 

I modified both external controler and the matsim core code. New features include: 
(1) Dynamic individual memory and social network which both evolve every iteration based on the agent's daily experience.
(2) New mode selecting procedure taking into account both individual memory, and friends' influence from social network.
